Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Lentivirus-GLUE-SRLV**: an extension to **[Lentivirus-GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE)**.

**Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs)** infect sheep and goats, causing chronic, lifelong diseases that impact various organ systems. 

The SRLV extension layer incorporates all published SRLV sequence data linked to associated metadata, including information that is sequence-associated (length, publication date); taxonomic (viral genotype, subtype); and isolate-associated (isolation host species, date and location of sampling, isolation source).

The SRLV extension of Lentivirus-GLUE provides functionality for genotyping SRLV sequences via **maximum likelihood**. Genotyping can be performed on any sequence of adequate length (typically >300 nucleotides are required for confident assignment). Any genomic region can be genotyped using the approach implemented in SRLV-GLUE.

Classification is based on maximum likelihood clade assignment (MLCA) as implemented in GLUE. Sequences are classified into genotypes and subtypes defined via phylogenetic analysis of full-length reference genome sequences.

For more details please see the Lentivirus-GLUE **[User Guide](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE/wiki/Small-Ruminant-Lentiviruses)**.

## Data Sources
